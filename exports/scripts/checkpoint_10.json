Last year was an exciting time for my personal projects!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1><a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv/timvideos/hdmi2usb/2016/01/11/new-year-roadmap/\">TimVideos.us 2016 New Year’s Resolutions</a></h1>\n<hr/>\n<p>Hello everyone,</p>\n<p>Hope everyone has had an awesome start to 2016 so far. As is tradition in many western countries, I thought I would put together some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_resolution\">New Year’s Resolutions</a> and reflect on our progress in 2015. I guess more business minded people might call it a “project roadmap” 🙂</p>\n<h3 id=\"timvideos-project\"><a href=\"https://code.timvideos.us/\">TimVideos Project</a></h3>\n<p>In 2015, I decided to focus the <a href=\"https://code.timvideos.us/\">TimVideos project</a> on the <a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv/\">HDMI2USB project</a>. The three key results of this focus were;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starting and completing a <a href=\"https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-misoc-firmware\">rewrite of the HDMI2USB firmware</a> based on the <a href=\"http://m-labs.hk/gateware.html\">Migen and MiSoC system developed by M-Labs</a>.</li>\n<li>Launching a <a href=\"http://crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis\">successful crowdfunding campaign</a> for <a href=\"https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-numato-opsis-hardware\">Numato Opsis</a>, our first open hardware for the HDMI2USB firmware.</li>\n<li>Having the HDMI2USB firmware on Atlys boards used in production by multiple people!\n<ul>\n<li>Carl Karsten from <a href=\"http://nextdayvideo.com/\">NextDayVideo</a> in the US for both PyCon ZA and Nodevember.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Videoteam\">DebConf Video team</a> for their <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/gb/2015/MiniDebConfCambridge#Video\">MiniDebConf in November</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/mithro\">Myself for recording</a> my own talks on the HDMI2USB project at user groups here in Sydney!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the success of this focus in 2015, the <a href=\"https://code.timvideos.us/\">TimVideos project</a> is going to continue to focus on the<a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv/\">HDMI2USB project</a> for 2016 (and I’ll go into more detailed goals shortly).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://code.timvideos.us/\">TimVideos project</a> has also been mildly successful in collaborating with other open source groups doing things related to video recording and production. In 2016, I hope we can strengthen these bonds and forge new ones. Some specific goals around this include;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting the TimVideos project to join <a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/\">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> (or similar organisation).</li>\n<li>Figure out the right way to collaborate with the <a href=\"https://c3voc.de/\">C3VOC team</a> on <a href=\"https://github.com/voc/voctomix\">voctomix</a> and start adding missing features from <a href=\"https://github.com/timvideos/gst-switch\">gst-switch</a> allowing that project to be retired.</li>\n<li>Continue to work with supporting groups like <a href=\"http://nextdayvideo.com/\">NextDayVideo</a>, the <a href=\"https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Videoteam\">DebConf Video team</a> and <a href=\"https://linux.org.au/\">Linux Australia</a>.</li>\n<li>Support and help <a href=\"http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/FPGA_Projects\">Mike “Hamster” Field</a> continue to develop a <a href=\"https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_DisplayPort\">fully open source DisplayPort core</a>.</li>\n<li>Collaborate with the <a href=\"http://apertus.org/\">apertus° project</a> on high end (4k and greater!) video capture and processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"hdmi2usb-project\"><a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv\">HDMI2USB Project</a></h3>\n<p>As we are concentrating on the <a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv\">HDMI2USB project</a>, we have some specific goals around that.</p>\n<p>HDMI2USB <strong>firmware</strong> goals;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactor the HDMI core to allow support a wider range of interfaces, better debugging and addition of more features. A document about the refactor has been <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/mithis.com/document/d/1L8lz7u2uj6MrzSQv4b1Vk6Rmic26okyRklOju5IWLYA/edit?usp=drive_web\">started here</a>.</li>\n<li>Add support for the <a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv/timvideos/hdmi2usb/2016/01/11/new-year-roadmap/\">high-speed GTP transceivers</a> and <a href=\"http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/FPGA_Projects\">Mike “Hamster” Field</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_DisplayPort\">open source DisplayPort core</a>.</li>\n<li>Get Ethernet support working (on both the Atlys and Opsis boards). The two major Ethernet features are;\n<ul>\n<li>Ethernet supports identical capture and control feature set to the USB port.</li>\n<li>Allowing HDMI2USB boards to act has “HDMI over Ethernet extenders”.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv/potential-boards/\">Support for more hardware</a>;\n<ul>\n<li>miniSpartan6+</li>\n<li>Digilent Nexys Video</li>\n<li>New HDMI2USB designed hardware!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Stretch Goals (1)\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjM1Brrks0lg1CJp2Rt1BH8-MhJamrKUeCUB4s4nzoA/edit\">hardware based mixing</a>.</li>\n<li>Have either a RTOS or Linux running on the FPGA softcore.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HDMI2USB <strong>hardware</strong> goals;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(By end of year) Development of a low cost PCI-Express capture card.</li>\n<li>(By middle 2017) Development of an Opsis V2 based around either an high end Artix-7 or a low end Kintex-7 FPGA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>(1): Stretch goals are things we plan to try and achieve if things go well.</em></p>\n<p>Hope this update give you an idea of what we have planned for 2016!

Some of the reasons we decided to start from scratch was;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A “de facto standard” for locking HDMI ports was established and low cost connectors became available. This meant we no longer needed to support both DVI and HDMI connectors, reducing the complexity significantly and solving some persistent issues.</li>\n<li>Not only did the cost of Spartan 6 parts with high speed “GTP” transceivers drop but our understanding of how to use them increased. This would allow us to create a board which natively supports DisplayPort.</li>\n<li>The idea streaming via not only USB, but also Ethernet became a stronger possibility, meaning the extra cost of adding ethernet was now worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, our board has the following differences with the Atlys board;</p>\n<ul style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Has DDR3 memory instead of DDR2, increasing the memory bandwidth.</span></li>\n<li>Has a Spartan S6LX45<strong>T</strong> with the GTP broken out to DisplayPort headers.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Has a PCI-Express style expansion connector instead of the expensive VHDCI connector, allow much cheaper expansion boards.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Has all the extra pins on the FX2, increasing the potential USB interface options.</span></li>\n<li>Has control over all the HDMI functionality, including hot plug and CEC functionality.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Removes parts we don’t need such as the audio, </span>buttons, switches and LEDs.</li>\n<li>Mounts in any ITX style computer case.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Adds UTMI USB (as well as the Cypress FX2)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Adds MicroSD connector.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",
