<p>So last year at the end of November I spoke at OSDC. I had been meaning to blog about the conference but never gotten around to doing so. The conference was great, but like previous OSDC’s I came down with something. Sadly, this meant that missed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tridgell">Andrew Tridgell’s</a> talk about the <a href="http://people.samba.org/people/2008/10/22#a-year-since-microsofts-appeal-failed">EU-Microsoft agreement</a>. Joel, who had been camped out in my lounge room for the week, said it was really worth listening too. I really wish OSDC recorded all the talks like Linux.conf.au does.</p>
<p>As part of speaking at the conference I had to produce a paper. This paper puts into writing a lot of what I have <a href="http://blog.mithis.net/archives/games/82-techtalk-gamingforfreedom">been talking about</a>. I wasn’t going to post it, but after getting a email out of the blue about the topic, I’ve decided to <a href="http://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/osdc-paper.pdf">put a copy here on my blog</a>. I might as well also upload the <a href="http://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/osdc-presentation.pdf">presentation I gave</a>, but it won’t be very interesting by itself. Both are released under a CC-BY-SA.</p>
<p>If there is one thing that any budding game developer (open source or otherwise) should take away from this talk, it is the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>When a person is looking for normal software, <span style="color: #ff0000;">they have an issue to solve.</span><br/>
When looking for computer games, <span style="color: #ff0000;">they are looking to be entertained.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>This fundamental difference in mindset should drive every aspect of your game, website and release process.</p>
<p><i>Edit: How could I forget? A big thanks goes out to <a href="http://www.hawthornlandings.org/">Leslie Hawthorn</a> who helped proof read the paper and making it much easier to read!</i></p>
