<p>As it’s only a couple of weeks till another<a href="http://www.lca2010.org.nz/"> Linux.conf.au</a> is underway, I thought I better post this draft from the last one! This year LCA is in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Wellington,+New+Zealand&amp;btnG=Search+Maps">Wellington, New Zealand</a>, sadly I didn’t get my act together enough to make a proper holiday of it. I’m definitely looking forward to catching up with all the cool hackers at the conference.</p>
<p>One of the best talks I went to <a href="http://linux.conf.au">Linux.conf.au</a> last year was the <a href="http://www.ksplice.com/">Ksplice</a> talk. This is a wonderful tool which allows people to develop “hot patches” so that you never need to reboot again. The developers have done some very cool work which means for 88% of patches a hot fix can be generated automatically. The presenter was a really great speaker too, during the talk he explains some advanced concepts (like hot to fix-up memory structures) I was able to easily understand it all. I can’t watch until I <strong>never</strong> have to reboot my Linux machines again!</p>
<p>I also attended <a href="http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/">Rusty</a>‘s tutorial on hacking <a href="http://http://lguest.ozlabs.org/">lguest</a>. Two years ago I submitted a <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.28.y.git;a=commitdiff;h=b488f22d70f1c2451618b9991b9665d2c6b31e2b">very important patch</a> to lguest which is now included in the kernel. This year I didn’t get as far as I had wanted mostly because I had not gotten enough sleep the night before. I did however submit one patch which was accepted. I guess that makes me a kernel hacker :).</p>
<p>Sadly, Rusty won’t be running another lguest tutorial this year, so it’s unlikely I’ll submit a third patch.</p>
