<p>Due to the focus on hardware, we are very interested in students who are interested in things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language">VHDL/Verilog and other HDLs</a>, embedded C programming and operating systems and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_design">electronic circuit/PCB design</a>. Some possible ideas include;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/5">Working on USB 3.0 support for ultra high speed video capture.</a></li>
<li>Porting a real operating system <a href="https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/30">such as Linux</a> or RTEMS to <a href="https://m-labs.hk/gateware.html">our SoC</a> to <a href="https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/33">allow easier development of new features</a>.</li>
<li>Making use of the <a href="https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/32">Ethernet interface for connecting multiple devices together</a> and alternative capture interfaces.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/2">Creating new expansion board and supporting the professional SDI standard</a>.</li>
