This is a [cross post](https://hdmi2usb.tv/gsoc/hdmi2usb/2016/03/14/gsoc-2016/) from the [HDMI2USB](https://hdmi2usb.tv) website.

# [TimVideos.us and Google Summer of Code 2016!](https://hdmi2usb.tv/timvideos/hdmi2usb/2016/01/11/new-year-roadmap/)
The [TimVideos.us project](https://code.timvideos.us/) is happy to announce that it has been selected to participate in the [Google Summer of Code for 2016 ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)(GSoC). GSoC is a program where students are paid to contribute to selected open source projects over the northern hemisphere summer, [flip bits not burgers](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/flip-bits-not-burgers-google-summer-of.html)!
[**The application period is now open**](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and [students have until 25 March 19:00 UTC to apply to work with the TimVideos.us project](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/). The [list of proposal ideas](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues) includes contributing to the [HDMI2USB](https://hdmi2usb.tv/) and things related to the [Numato Opsis](https://www.crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis).

Due to the focus on hardware, we are very interested in students who are interested in things like [VHDL/Verilog and other HDLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language), embedded C programming and operating systems and [electronic circuit/PCB design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_design). Some possible ideas include;
- [Working on USB 3.0 support for ultra high speed video capture.](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/5)
- Porting a real operating system [such as Linux](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/30) or RTEMS to [our SoC](https://m-labs.hk/gateware.html) to [allow easier development of new features](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/33).
- Making use of the [Ethernet interface for connecting multiple devices together](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/32) and alternative capture interfaces.
- [Creating new expansion board and supporting the professional SDI standard](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues/2).
- [and many, many more](https://github.com/timvideos/getting-started/issues).
If you are interested in applying, your first point of call should be [our Google Summer of Code page](https://code.timvideos.us/summer-of-code/). Even if you canâ€™t apply to GSoC, you can also help us by forwarding [this message to anyone you might think who is interested!](https://hdmi2usb.tv/gsoc/hdmi2usb/2016/03/14/gsoc-2016/)
