<div ><p>Well, not really – I’m in the Southern Hemisphere and Summer is yet to arrive. What I am ranting about is the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">“Google Summer of Code”</a>. This year, much to our suprise <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/">Thousand Parsec</a> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4x">space strategy empire building game</a> I founded “oh so many years ago”, <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/news.php/2007-03-16-0157">was selected to become a mentor organisation</a>.</p><p>We had <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/news.php/2007-04-14-1326">3 students accepted</a> into the program and then Google also agreed to <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/news.php/2007-06-05-1406">fund an extra student</a> outside the program! Sadly only 3 out of these 4 students passed the mid-term evaluation, but the <a href="http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpruledev.git;a=summary">work</a><a href="http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpserver-cpp.git;a=shortlog;h=rfts">they</a><a href="http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=metaserver-lite.git;a=shortlog;h=rewrite">have</a> been doing is really, really cool!</p><p>This last 6 months have been really rewarding personally. I started the project in 2001 and it has been a long slog to grow the project past just the other founder and me. With all these new people who are actively excited about the project (and not just the SoCers!) it has been a huge relief that time over the last 6 years has not been wasted. With myself recently graduating, the nature of my contributions to the project is going to change and it’s nice to know that others will be helping to keep the project alive.</p><p>It use to be the case that if I stop working on the project, no progress would be made. Now almost everytime I turn on the computer I <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/mailman.php/listinfo/tp-cvs">see new commits</a>. When I go to our <a href="http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi">gitweb</a> there is always a lot of green. It’s an absolutely wonderful feeling!</p><p>The next 6 months are also going to be really exciting, with <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/dev/documents/protocol4.php">TP04 reaching the final stages of specification</a>, a <a href="http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=web.git;a=shortlog;h=reorg">new website reorg</a>, a <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/wiki/Rulesets">bunch of new games</a> and an <a href="http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpclient-pywx.git;a=shortlog;h=development">almost complete rewrite of the primary client</a>. We might actually start attracting users :).<a href="http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpclient-pywx.git;a=shortlog;h=development"><br/></a></p></div>
