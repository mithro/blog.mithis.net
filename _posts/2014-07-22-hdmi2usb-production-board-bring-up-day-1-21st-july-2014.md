- Wrote snippets for the last 3 days.
- slidelint work
<li>Further updated some slidelint site documentation.
- Committed the [slidelint nginx configuration](https://github.com/enkidulan/slidelint_site/pull/4).
</li>
- Got set up in Joel and Rusty’s coworking space.
- Explained to Ajit the idea of routing the debug output to multiple locations. Added a diagram to the [Debug Design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19XB1AOZMp5Tr-nKEmX8CSuChd6O11wmKfwKc1nsk4OA/edit).
- Fixed command line processing in [hdl-pretty](https://github.com/mithro/hdl-pretty) code. Started down the path of auto-generating help from the customize stuff and then realised I had more important things to do.
- Got most of my way through a [Python program to generate UCF files](https://github.com/mithro/HDMI2USB/tree/generate-ucf) from the [HDMI2USB Variants](https://docs.google.com/a/mithis.com/spreadsheets/d/10vNcsOAxnuiwc5diespjIepMySxhR0iVZfYxouq4p-E/edit#gid=1936356070) spreadsheet.
- Xilinx “Compatible” JTAG programmer turned up at [Joel’s](http://jms.id.au) house. Yet to test to see if it works.
