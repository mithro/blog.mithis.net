# [TimVideos.us 2016 New Year‚Äôs Resolutions](https://hdmi2usb.tv/timvideos/hdmi2usb/2016/01/11/new-year-roadmap/)
<hr/>
Hello everyone,
Hope everyone has had an awesome start to 2016 so far. As is tradition in many western countries, I thought I would put together some [New Year‚Äôs Resolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_resolution) and reflect on our progress in 2015. I guess more business minded people might call it a ‚Äúproject roadmap‚Äù üôÇ
### [TimVideos Project](https://code.timvideos.us/)
In 2015, I decided to focus the [TimVideos project](https://code.timvideos.us/) on the [HDMI2USB project](https://hdmi2usb.tv/). The three key results of this focus were;
- Starting and completing a [rewrite of the HDMI2USB firmware](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-misoc-firmware) based on the [Migen and MiSoC system developed by M-Labs](http://m-labs.hk/gateware.html).
- Launching a [successful crowdfunding campaign](http://crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis) for [Numato Opsis](https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-numato-opsis-hardware), our first open hardware for the HDMI2USB firmware.
- Having the HDMI2USB firmware on Atlys boards used in production by multiple people!
- Carl Karsten from [NextDayVideo](http://nextdayvideo.com/) in the US for both PyCon ZA and Nodevember.
- The [DebConf Video team](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Videoteam) for their [MiniDebConf in November](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/gb/2015/MiniDebConfCambridge#Video).
- [Myself for recording](https://www.youtube.com/user/mithro) my own talks on the HDMI2USB project at user groups here in Sydney!

With the success of this focus in 2015, the [TimVideos project](https://code.timvideos.us/) is going to continue to focus on the[HDMI2USB project](https://hdmi2usb.tv/) for 2016 (and I‚Äôll go into more detailed goals shortly).
The [TimVideos project](https://code.timvideos.us/) has also been mildly successful in collaborating with other open source groups doing things related to video recording and production. In 2016, I hope we can strengthen these bonds and forge new ones. Some specific goals around this include;
- Getting the TimVideos project to join [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/) (or similar organisation).
- Figure out the right way to collaborate with the [C3VOC team](https://c3voc.de/) on [voctomix](https://github.com/voc/voctomix) and start adding missing features from [gst-switch](https://github.com/timvideos/gst-switch) allowing that project to be retired.
- Continue to work with supporting groups like [NextDayVideo](http://nextdayvideo.com/), the [DebConf Video team](https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Videoteam) and [Linux Australia](https://linux.org.au/).
- Support and help [Mike ‚ÄúHamster‚Äù Field](http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/FPGA_Projects) continue to develop a [fully open source DisplayPort core](https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_DisplayPort).
- Collaborate with the [apertus¬∞ project](http://apertus.org/) on high end (4k and greater!) video capture and processing.
### [HDMI2USB Project](https://hdmi2usb.tv)
As we are concentrating on the [HDMI2USB project](https://hdmi2usb.tv), we have some specific goals around that.
HDMI2USB **firmware** goals;
- Refactor the HDMI core to allow support a wider range of interfaces, better debugging and addition of more features. A document about the refactor has been [started here](https://docs.google.com/a/mithis.com/document/d/1L8lz7u2uj6MrzSQv4b1Vk6Rmic26okyRklOju5IWLYA/edit?usp=drive_web).
- Add support for the [high-speed GTP transceivers](https://hdmi2usb.tv/timvideos/hdmi2usb/2016/01/11/new-year-roadmap/) and [Mike ‚ÄúHamster‚Äù Field](http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/FPGA_Projects) [open source DisplayPort core](https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_DisplayPort).
- Get Ethernet support working (on both the Atlys and Opsis boards). The two major Ethernet features are;
- Ethernet supports identical capture and control feature set to the USB port.
- Allowing HDMI2USB boards to act has ‚ÄúHDMI over Ethernet extenders‚Äù.

- [Support for more hardware](https://hdmi2usb.tv/potential-boards/);
- miniSpartan6+
- Digilent Nexys Video
- New HDMI2USB designed hardware!

- Stretch Goals (1)
- Add support for [hardware based mixing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjM1Brrks0lg1CJp2Rt1BH8-MhJamrKUeCUB4s4nzoA/edit).
- Have either a RTOS or Linux running on the FPGA softcore.

HDMI2USB **hardware** goals;
- (By end of year) Development of a low cost PCI-Express capture card.
- (By middle 2017) Development of an Opsis V2 based around either an high end Artix-7 or a low end Kintex-7 FPGA.
*(1): Stretch goals are things we plan to try and achieve if things go well.*
Hope this update give you an idea of what we have planned for 2016! We would love your help making it all possible.
