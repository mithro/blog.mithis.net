Well, I am back at work after spending last week at [Linux.conf.au,](http://linux.conf.au) it was a huge amount of fun and the organisers did a great job. I am really happy that I got to catch up with all the people cool I had not seen for almost a year. We managed to have a [Thousand Parsec](http://www.thousandparsec.net/)[developer meeting](http://www.thousandparsec.net/wiki/LCA08_Dev_Meeting) which was pretty fruitful. As with last year, I ran the [Gaming Miniconf](http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming) and a large “Open Source Gaming” stand on [Open Day](http://linux.conf.au/programme/open-day).
The Gaming Miniconf was a little slow to start, my first speaker turned up late and my second speaker was unable to get his laptop to work with the projector. I was disappointed with the turn out during the morning, last year we easily had 70 people for most of the day, while this year it was closer to 40. The competition for people’s attention in the morning was tough, there where [8 other miniconfs](http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page#Tuesday_the_29th_of_January_2008) running. The keynote speeches before the Miniconfs last year, really helped make everyone was getting out of bed.
I am much happier with the afternoon, things ran significantly smoother and the [pyglet](http://pyglet.org/) tutorial was a huge hit. It was amazing to watch Richard and Alex work, they really should give a main conference tutorial next year. I am currently encoding all the talks and hope to have them up very soon (for those who where silly enough to attend the wrong Miniconf). Watch this space for more information.
The Open Day was pretty cool, I would like to thank all the helpers – they did a great job and allowed me to concentrate on organising things (like setting up hardware and finding lunch for everyone). I do wish that the Open Day venue was much larger, it was rather cramped for most of the day. The open day is one of the best events we have to show the general public all the cool things FOSS is doing and I would like to see it become a bigger and longer event.
I belive that previously Miniconf organisers had been given the short end of the stick. The effort required to organise a Miniconf is significantly more then required for a talk, yet they received none of the perks or recognition that speakers did. I’m glad that the organising committee decided to make a change this year and I feel this small gesture made a huge difference.
Of course, I also managed to attended a number of cool talks. I would recommend [going and watching some of them](http://www.linux.conf.au/programme/presentations).
