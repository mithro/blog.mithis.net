I have been meaning to post here for quite a while but have been busy doing [nothing](http://www.thousandparsec.net/).
As anyone who chats on IRC with me knows, I got my “Eligible to Graduate” letter from my University. This means that as of the 31st of July I will officially have both a “Bachelor of Engineering (Information Technology and Telecommunications)” and a “Bachelor of Arts” in Philosophy. I’ve been studying at Uni for 5+1/2 years, so I will be glad to finally leave. The last 6 months of Uni have been the most enjoyable because I have spent most of the time working on my [Honours project](/archives/uni/41-cfxs-all-done), I did pretty well (ended up with 94% which is a High Distinction).
I’ve been working on a little contract that I picked up off the [Linux Australia](http://linux.org.au) [jobs list](http://lists.linux.org.au/listinfo/jobs). Sadly it’s not open source, but it should tide me over for about a month. I badly need to update my Resume as I haven’t needed it for about 4 years.
I’m still yet to calculate the numbers to work out if going commercial with my [Honours project](/archives/uni/41-cfxs-all-done) is going to be worth pursuing. [David Rowie](http://www.rowetel.com/) has been giving me some advice and templates to work with. He has been working embedded Asterisk which is very cool.
