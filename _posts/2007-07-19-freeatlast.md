<p>I have been meaning to post here for quite a while but have been busy doing <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/">nothing</a>.</p>
<p>As anyone who chats on IRC with me knows, I got my “Eligible to Graduate” letter from my University. This means that as of the 31st of July I will officially have both a “Bachelor of Engineering (Information Technology and Telecommunications)” and a “Bachelor of Arts” in Philosophy. I’ve been studying at Uni for 5+1/2 years, so I will be glad to finally leave. The last 6 months of Uni have been the most enjoyable because I have spent most of the time working on my <a href="/archives/uni/41-cfxs-all-done">Honours project</a>, I did pretty well (ended up with 94% which is a High Distinction).</p>
<p>I’ve been working on a little contract that I picked up off the <a href="http://linux.org.au" title="Linux Australia">Linux Australia</a> <a href="http://lists.linux.org.au/listinfo/jobs">jobs list</a>. Sadly it’s not open source, but it should tide me over for about a month. I badly need to update my Resume as I haven’t needed it for about 4 years.</p>
<p>I’m still yet to calculate the numbers to work out if going commercial with my <a href="/archives/uni/41-cfxs-all-done">Honours project</a> is going to be worth pursuing. <a href="http://www.rowetel.com/">David Rowie</a> has been giving me some advice and templates to work with. He has been working embedded Asterisk which is very cool.</p>
