<p>Well, I am going to <a href="http://nextwavefreeplay.blogspot.com/" title="FreePlay">FreePlay</a> this weekend. I will be giving a talk about FOSS Game Development called “The best things in life are free”. If you are in Melbourne and have nothing to do on Saturday, why not come a long and see some cool talks?</p>
<p>I am running the <a href="http://gaming.miniconf.org/">Gaming Miniconf</a> at LCA 2008 (I also ran it at <a href="http://www.linux.org.au/conf/2007/Miniconfs/Gaming.1.html">2007</a>) which I will be advertising. I have also managed to organised to have <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au 2008</a> postcards given out at the registration desk, which is pretty cool.</p>
