Well, I am going to [FreePlay](http://nextwavefreeplay.blogspot.com/) this weekend. I will be giving a talk about FOSS Game Development called “The best things in life are free”. If you are in Melbourne and have nothing to do on Saturday, why not come a long and see some cool talks?
I am running the [Gaming Miniconf](http://gaming.miniconf.org/) at LCA 2008 (I also ran it at [2007](http://www.linux.org.au/conf/2007/Miniconfs/Gaming.1.html)) which I will be advertising. I have also managed to organised to have [linux.conf.au 2008](http://linux.conf.au/) postcards given out at the registration desk, which is pretty cool.
