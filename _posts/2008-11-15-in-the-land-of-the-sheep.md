*I wrote this post while in New Zealand but never posted it, now Iâ€™m at Linux.conf.au I have time to finish it up.*
Well its been a long time since I have posted on my blog. As I lasted mentioned I now work at Google, which has been going well but keeping me fairly busy. For the last month (October, 2009) I have been back in Mountain View, California. While I was there for mainly work purposes, I did get the chance to go to both the [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc)[Mentor Summit](https://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/Main_Page) and the [GitTogether](http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitTogether). Both where a lot of fun but tiering. 
It was good to see the [BZFlag](http://bzflag.org) guys again â€“ they even had cool t-shirts this year. Not as cool as our [Thousand Parsec shirts](http://www.cafepress.com/thousandparsec.123836466), however. ðŸ™‚ I was finally able to meet kblin who I had know through the [WorldForge](http://www.worldforge.org) project for many years. As always he looked nothing like I expected.
At the GitTogther I was mainly interested in trying to make git usable with large media repositories. This is one area which Subversion still has an advantage. After much discussion we came up with a solution to the problem which [I gave a short presentation](http://www.thousandparsec.net/~tim/media+git.pdf).
It also gave me a chance to catch up with the Open Source Progams Office. It was great to catch up with [Leslie Hawthorn](http://www.hawthornlandings.org/) and her fabulous crew.
No sooner had I gotten back from the states, I headed of to New Zealand. [Lee Begg](http://llnz.dyndns.org/) who I also first met through the WorldForge project and was the co-founder of the Thousand Parsec project, is getting married and I will be a grooms man.
