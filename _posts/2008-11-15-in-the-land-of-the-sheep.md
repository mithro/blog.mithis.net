<div ><p><i>I wrote this post while in New Zealand but never posted it, now Iâ€™m at Linux.conf.au I have time to finish it up.</i></p><p>Well its been a long time since I have posted on my blog. As I lasted mentioned I now work at Google, which has been going well but keeping me fairly busy. For the last month (October, 2009) I have been back in Mountain View, California. While I was there for mainly work purposes, I did get the chance to go to both the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc">Summer of Code</a><a href="https://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/Main_Page">Mentor Summit</a> and the <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitTogether">GitTogether</a>. Both where a lot of fun but tiering. </p><p>It was good to see the <a href="http://bzflag.org">BZFlag</a> guys again â€“ they even had cool t-shirts this year. Not as cool as our <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/thousandparsec.123836466">Thousand Parsec shirts</a>, however. ðŸ™‚ I was finally able to meet kblin who I had know through the <a href="http://www.worldforge.org">WorldForge</a> project for many years. As always he looked nothing like I expected.</p><p>At the GitTogther I was mainly interested in trying to make git usable with large media repositories. This is one area which Subversion still has an advantage. After much discussion we came up with a solution to the problem which <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/~tim/media+git.pdf">I gave a short presentation</a>.</p><p>It also gave me a chance to catch up with the Open Source Progams Office. It was great to catch up with <a href="http://www.hawthornlandings.org/">Leslie Hawthorn</a> and her fabulous crew.</p><p>No sooner had I gotten back from the states, I headed of to New Zealand. <a href="http://llnz.dyndns.org/">Lee Begg</a> who I also first met through the WorldForge project and was the co-founder of the Thousand Parsec project, is getting married and I will be a grooms man.</p></div>
