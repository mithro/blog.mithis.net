<div ><p>As some of you may know, I was invited to speak about my experiences with Open Source games at the <a href="http://www.nextwave.org.au/news/free-play-a-mere-month-away-get-your-tickets-now">Independent Game Developers conference, Freeplay</a>. The conference was in Melbourne at the <a href="http://www.acmi.net.au/">ACMI</a> and at my guess around 250 people attended the event.</p><p>I organised with the Freeplay organisers to have <a href="http://linux.conf.au">Linux.conf.au</a> postcards available at the registration desk and dotted around the other venues. About 100 cards where picked up and the remainder where given to Geoff Leach (who lectures at <a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/">RMIT</a>) to distribute to students. I also advertised the “<a href="http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php/Gaming">Gaming Miniconf</a>” which I will be organising at <a href="http://linux.conf.au">Linux.conf.au</a>.</p><p>I gave a talk entitled “The best things in life are free” which was split into two sections. The first was an introduction to what FOSS actually is, while the second was a brief tour of various open source game technologies and games which exist. I hoped to show how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer#Independent_developers">independent game developers</a> and open source game developers where closer then both sides realise.</p><p>The talk went well and there seemed quite a bit of interest. There was quite a bit of interest (among game library developers) in the dual-licensing model that <a href="http://www.mysql.org/">MySQL</a> and <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Trolltech</a> both use. More importantly many of the upcoming game development students attending were interested in both using open source and open sourcing their own games.</p><p>I also talked directly to a variety of leading Australian game developers to find out how, where and why they are using FOSS in there company and games. As I have <a href="http://www.linux.org.au/conf/2007/Miniconfs/Gaming/ProgramNew.html">previously thought</a> (and discussed at last year’s <a href="http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php/Gaming">Gaming Miniconf</a>), the amount of FOSS being used is extensive. <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, for example, been embedded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_%E2%80%93_Bloodlines">in</a><a href="http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/home.htm">many</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temple_of_Elemental_Evil_(computer_game)">AAA</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_2">games</a> and is used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVE_Online">multiple</a><a href="http://www.bigworldtech.com/index/index_en.php">MMORPGs</a>. Hopefully I will have some cool case studies very soon.</p></div>
