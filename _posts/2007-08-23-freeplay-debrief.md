As some of you may know, I was invited to speak about my experiences with Open Source games at the [Independent Game Developers conference, Freeplay](http://www.nextwave.org.au/news/free-play-a-mere-month-away-get-your-tickets-now). The conference was in Melbourne at the [ACMI](http://www.acmi.net.au/) and at my guess around 250 people attended the event.
I organised with the Freeplay organisers to have [Linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au) postcards available at the registration desk and dotted around the other venues. About 100 cards where picked up and the remainder where given to Geoff Leach (who lectures at [RMIT](http://www.rmit.edu.au/)) to distribute to students. I also advertised the “[Gaming Miniconf](http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php/Gaming)” which I will be organising at [Linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au).
I gave a talk entitled “The best things in life are free” which was split into two sections. The first was an introduction to what FOSS actually is, while the second was a brief tour of various open source game technologies and games which exist. I hoped to show how the [independent game developers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer#Independent_developers) and open source game developers where closer then both sides realise.
The talk went well and there seemed quite a bit of interest. There was quite a bit of interest (among game library developers) in the dual-licensing model that [MySQL](http://www.mysql.org/) and [Trolltech](http://www.trolltech.com/) both use. More importantly many of the upcoming game development students attending were interested in both using open source and open sourcing their own games.
I also talked directly to a variety of leading Australian game developers to find out how, where and why they are using FOSS in there company and games. As I have [previously thought](http://www.linux.org.au/conf/2007/Miniconfs/Gaming/ProgramNew.html) (and discussed at last year’s [Gaming Miniconf](http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php/Gaming)), the amount of FOSS being used is extensive. [Python](http://www.python.org/), for example, been embedded [in](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_%E2%80%93_Bloodlines)[many](http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/home.htm)[AAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Temple_of_Elemental_Evil_(computer_game))[games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_2) and is used in [multiple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVE_Online)[MMORPGs](http://www.bigworldtech.com/index/index_en.php). Hopefully I will have some cool case studies very soon.
