As announced at [Linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au/), I’m happy to point out that we have finally [anounced the 0.3.0 release of the Thousand Parsec client](http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/news.php/2008-02-18-2107) which I work on.
>  It’s been a long time since the last release of the primary client for playing [Thousand Parsec games](http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/). Now, the wait is finally over and it was well worth it. Large parts of the client have drastically changed. Connecting to game servers is simplified. The new user interace enables you to more easily see important information and then more efficiently issue orders. Translation support makes it possible to conqueror the universe in your mother language. For all the details check out the full release announcement. If you downloaded a previous release and didn’t like it, please give [this new release a try](http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/downloads.php#tpclient-pywx)!
