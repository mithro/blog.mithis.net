As Iâ€™m too lazy to write a post myself, here is one from JLP:

Google has just published the list of accepted mentoring organizations for [Google Summer of Code 2008](http://www.thousandparsec.net/) and it is great to see that Thousand Parsec has made it once again. We must be doing something right ðŸ™‚
So, if you are into turn-based [4X space strategy games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4x_game) and would like to help in game development, this is your chance. Take a look at our [Google Summer of Code](http://www.thousandparsec.net/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code) and [Ideas for Programmers pages](http://www.thousandparsec.net/wiki/Ideas_for_Programmers) and get involved. There is even US$ 4500 to encourage you to take that step into the world of open source software programming.
Interested students now have about a week to get to know us better. You can chat with us on IRC ([Freenode network, #tp channel](irc://irc.freenode.org/#p)) or write to our [development mailing list](http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/mailman.php/listinfo/tp-devel). Starting March 24 student applications can be submitted, **all applications must be in by March 31**. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m looking forward to be a mentor again.
