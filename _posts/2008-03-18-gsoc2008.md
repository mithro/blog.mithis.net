<div ><p>As Iâ€™m too lazy to write a post myself, here is one from JLP:</p><blockquote><p>
Google has just published the list of accepted mentoring organizations for <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/">Google Summer of Code 2008</a> and it is great to see that Thousand Parsec has made it once again. We must be doing something right ðŸ™‚</p><p>So, if you are into turn-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4x_game">4X space strategy games</a> and would like to help in game development, this is your chance. Take a look at our <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/wiki/Ideas_for_Programmers">Ideas for Programmers pages</a> and get involved. There is even US$ 4500 to encourage you to take that step into the world of open source software programming.</p><p>Interested students now have about a week to get to know us better. You can chat with us on IRC (<a href="irc://irc.freenode.org/#p">Freenode network, #tp channel</a>) or write to our <a href="http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/mailman.php/listinfo/tp-devel">development mailing list</a>. Starting March 24 student applications can be submitted, <strong>all applications must be in by March 31</strong>. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m looking forward to be a mentor again.
