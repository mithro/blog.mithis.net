<p>Well, as of Wednesday I have completed my Honours project. On Wednesday I gave my final presentation for the project and it went really well (at least for me).  It is a great relief to have finally “finished” something which I have been working on for a good 10 months of my life.  I have spent the last couple of days recovering.</p>
<p>The day was way more stressful then it needed to be. I needed quite a bit of time to setup for my presentation (I need to setup 8 telephones at various locations and get the power supply and such working. However, the room I had been scheduled to give my presentation room which was being used all morning. It then took us ages to find a room which I could use, we ended up using the student study room.</p>
<p>The demonstration worked pretty well. I had two problems, but neither of them where significant or really noticed by the moderator or supervisor.</p>
<p>My documentation turned out pretty good too. I was required to produce two documents, the first was a “<a href="/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/final-report-small.pdf" title="Honours Project - Final Report"> Final Report</a>” which covered what I actually did. The second was as a “<a href="/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/technical-small.pdf" title="Honours Project - Technical Document">Technical Document</a>“, my supervisor suggested I do this in the form of a data sheet for my project. I’ve attached both the documents here for people to have a look over.</p>
<p>So where do I go from here? Most people just stop once they had done their final project. The University has some strange rules about collaboration on Honours projects, so I wasn’t able to do this project as an piece of Open Source Hardware. Now however that restriction has been lifted, over the next couple of months I hope to move it all to Open Source.</p>
<p>It also turns out that a <a href="http://www.rowetel.com/ucasterisk/index.html">guy working on embedded Asterisk</a> lives just around the corner from me. I invited him along to my presentation and he is now helping me pursue getting this device on to the market.</p>
<p>At the current price point, it looks likes is it possible to do the 8  FXS channel USB device for around $US 300. Hopefully, we can get this down even lower, ultimately my end target is for it to be half that price. If you are interested in the device (either as a developer or as an end user) I would love to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20081017054327/mailto:cfxs@mithis.com">hear from you</a>.</p>
