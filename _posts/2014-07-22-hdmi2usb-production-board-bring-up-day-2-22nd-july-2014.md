<h3>Non-HDMI2USB related stuff</h3> <ul> <li>Answered a bunch of work emails.</li> <li>Read and answered bunch of PyCon AU related emails.</li> <li>Fix <a href="https://dlv.isc.org">DLV records</a> for a bunch of domains.</li> <li>Helped <a href="http://aps-sids.github.io/porting-flumotion/2014/07/21/flumotion-dvswitch-problems/">aps-sids with flumotion porting work</a>.</li> </ul> <h3>HDMI2USB related stuff</h3> <ul> <li>Worked from Joel&#8217;s house today to <a href="https://www.fedex.com/fedextrack/html/oldindex.html?tracknumbers=770633168459&amp;cntry_code=au&amp;language=en">receive the production HDMI2USB boards</a>, they didn&#8217;t turn up <img alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f641.png" style="height: 1em;" /></li> <li>Create a <a href="https://blog.mithis.net/build.hdmi2usb.tv">trusty VM on server</a> for Joel to setup HDMI2USB CI on.</li> <li>Investigated origin of files in HDMI2USB code. Current status seems to be; <ul> <li>hdl/edid &#8211; Written by us (Jahanzeb).</li> <li>hdl/hdmi &#8211; Mostly written by Xilinx and released in application notes. Need to figure out the exact licensing of the files (are they MIT? Only for use on Xilinx parts?) and move them to third party.</li> <li>hdl/jpeg_encoder &#8211; OpenCores mkjpeg core.
