<div ><p>As you may <a href="http://lists.linux.org.au/pipermail/linux-aus/2007-October/015998.html" title="LCA 08 Announcement">have already noticed</a>, <a href="http://linux.conf.au/" title="Linux.conf.au 2008">Linux.conf.au 2008</a> has announce that registrations are finally open, woot! If you are planning on coming, don’t forget to come to the best miniconf there is, the <a href="http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming">Gaming Miniconf</a>! I am running it again this year and it is going to be packed with Gaming and Game Development goodness.</p><p>Much to my embarrassment I managed to accidentally announce the fact early to the #linux.conf.au channel, I just happened to check the website for some <a href="http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming">Gaming Miniconf</a> business and noticed the <a href="http://linux.conf.au/__data/assets/image/0018/567/register-orange.png">registration button</a>. Thinking I had missed the announcement (it has been long day) I hopped on to the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.org/#linux.conf.au">#linux.conf.au</a> channel to ask how long it had been opened. Turned out they had just started doing some testing and thanks to me the whole channel jump on being the first to register. Sorry guys!</p><p>I have booked my flights and registered, so I am all good to go.</p></div>
