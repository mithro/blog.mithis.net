<p>About 6 months ago I started interviewing with <a href="http://www.google.com.au/">Google Australia</a> and about a month ago they made me a job offer that I could not refuse. So now I’m packing my bags and heading to Sydney, I start work in about three weeks but I am being sent to the States for some training first. Unlike most of the Googlers in Sydney, I’m not going to be working on <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>.</p>
<p>I’m very excited too start working with Google but it has been pretty big decision to make. I have never moved anywhere permanently before and I’m currently still living at home with my parents. I did live in Sweden for 6 months, but that was always with the intention of coming back home. On the other hand, it is not like I am moving to totally a different country and I already have loads of friends and family living in Sydney.</p>
<p>I have been thinking that I want to move to a big city for a number of reasons. An example of this that I often use, is that “I want to be able to order pizza after midnight”. It is annoying that just when I’ve started getting more involved in the <a href="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/">local</a> <a href="http://www.rowetel.com/">FOSS</a> <a href="http://groups.google.com.au/group/Bettong?hl=en">groups</a> I’m leaving for another state. I do hope to continually be involved with <a href="http://www.slug.org.au/">SLUG</a> and other FOSS events going on in Sydney too.</p>
<p>I’ve spent most of this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_day">ANZAC Day</a> long weekend trying to organize all my stuff. You never realize how much crap you have until you decide to move and I don’t even own any furniture yet! Luckily my parents have plenty of storage space. Having never done this before, I’m sure that I’m probably doing it all wrong.</p>
<p>I’m a little bit of a technology pack rat (like most geeks) but I have been trying to give away all the old computer bits that I had always being meaning to fix or use. There should be plenty of happy Adelaide FOSS people soon <img alt=";)"  src="http://web.archive.org/web/20110311022506im_/http://blog.mithis.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif"/> </p>
<p>If you are in Adelaide and want to catch up before I head off (Friday the 16th), or in Sydney (or even the Mountain View, USA) and want to come and say “Hi!” please feel free to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110311022506/mailto://mithis.com/">email me</a>.</p>
