Well here is a binary, I have tested under Windows 2000 and Windows XP. It should also run under Windows Vista too, but I don’t have a copy of it to test with.
It currently only supports the modules it has been linked against. This means that it will only support MiniSec and no persistence modules.
You can download it using the following link [Windows Binary of tpserver-cpp.](http://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/tpserver-standalone.zip)
