<p>Well here is a binary, I have tested under Windows 2000 and Windows XP. It should also run under Windows Vista too, but I don’t have a copy of it to test with.</p>
<p>It currently only supports the modules it has been linked against. This means that it will only support MiniSec and no persistence modules.</p>
<p>You can download it using the following link <a href="http://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/tpserver-standalone.zip" title="Windows Binary of tpserver-cpp">Windows Binary of tpserver-cpp.</a></p>
