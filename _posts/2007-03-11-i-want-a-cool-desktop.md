<p>I upgraded my laptop to Feisty this weekend to see if there was anything good. One thing I have been hoping for is to get <a href="http://www.beryl-project.org/">Beryl</a> running on this laptop.</p>
<p>I tried a couple of times to get it working, however it starts of fine and then goes down hill. It just seems that my graphics card which is an evil <a href="http://xorg.freedesktop.org/archive/X11R7.0/doc/html/i810.4.html">Intel Extreme 855</a> just isn’t fast enough.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons I want Beryl,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.beryl-project.org/images/scale_full.jpg">The Scale Effect</a>, this is where you put your mouse up in the top corner and all your windows are laid out so you can easily select the one you want.</li>
<li><a href="http://lunapark6.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/Thumbnail-Amarok-02.jpg">Task Bar window previews</a>, this is where you mouse over a task bar item and a little preview of the item appears. This again makes it easy to switch tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also two “bugs” which prevent me from using beryl even if it worked.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have an auto hide gnome panel on the right hand side of my desktop. I use it to display “status” about my computer and my notification area is also there. This panel doesn’t pop-up when Beryl is running, it appears to be caused by the edge switcher which allows you to rotate the cube.</li>
<li>I also use the <a href="http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/">Deskbar Applet</a> a huge amount. It’s really handy to type Ctrl-F3 and get a box you can use to do all sorts of things. (I use it mainly as a glorified run box).</li>
</ul>
<p>I have to wonder however, these features shouldn’t really need a 3d desktop. For live preview they would, but I don’t really care about seeing my Video’s or 3d applications running while I’m just trying to find them. I guess it’s comes down to, 3d hardware is cheap, programmer time is not, hence it’ll only be done in 3d.</p>
<p>On a side note, I do like a bunch of new features in Feisty,</p>
<ul>
<li>Suspend is fast again! It takes less then 3 seconds to get back to my desktop when coming our of Suspend to Ram. Previously it would take up to a minute!</li>
<li>New <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">gaim</a> is cool. A lot of the small annoyances I had with the gaim in Edgy have been fixed.</li>
<li>It boots faster. Not that I reboot often, with Suspend to Ram I hardly ever reboot.</li>
<li>Automatic Codec downloads. <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/totem/">Totem</a> will now ask me to install the correct plugin packages to play media it can’t play.</li>
<li>Cleaner default theme. The default theme for gnome is that little bit nicer and cleaner.</li>
<li>Newer <a href="http://liferea.sourceforge.net/">Liferea</a>.</li>
<li>Ephiphany has Titles in the URL drop down.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it’s not a major change, just a continually progress towards perfection.</p>
