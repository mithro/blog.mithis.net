I upgraded my laptop to Feisty this weekend to see if there was anything good. One thing I have been hoping for is to get [Beryl](http://www.beryl-project.org/) running on this laptop.
I tried a couple of times to get it working, however it starts of fine and then goes down hill. It just seems that my graphics card which is an evil [Intel Extreme 855](http://xorg.freedesktop.org/archive/X11R7.0/doc/html/i810.4.html) just isn’t fast enough.
There are two main reasons I want Beryl,
- [The Scale Effect](http://www.beryl-project.org/images/scale_full.jpg), this is where you put your mouse up in the top corner and all your windows are laid out so you can easily select the one you want.
- [Task Bar window previews](http://lunapark6.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/Thumbnail-Amarok-02.jpg), this is where you mouse over a task bar item and a little preview of the item appears. This again makes it easy to switch tasks.
There are also two “bugs” which prevent me from using beryl even if it worked.
- I have an auto hide gnome panel on the right hand side of my desktop. I use it to display “status” about my computer and my notification area is also there. This panel doesn’t pop-up when Beryl is running, it appears to be caused by the edge switcher which allows you to rotate the cube.
- I also use the [Deskbar Applet](http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/) a huge amount. It’s really handy to type Ctrl-F3 and get a box you can use to do all sorts of things. (I use it mainly as a glorified run box).
I have to wonder however, these features shouldn’t really need a 3d desktop. For live preview they would, but I don’t really care about seeing my Video’s or 3d applications running while I’m just trying to find them. I guess it’s comes down to, 3d hardware is cheap, programmer time is not, hence it’ll only be done in 3d.
On a side note, I do like a bunch of new features in Feisty,
- Suspend is fast again! It takes less then 3 seconds to get back to my desktop when coming our of Suspend to Ram. Previously it would take up to a minute!
- New [gaim](http://gaim.sourceforge.net/) is cool. A lot of the small annoyances I had with the gaim in Edgy have been fixed.
- It boots faster. Not that I reboot often, with Suspend to Ram I hardly ever reboot.
- Automatic Codec downloads. [Totem](http://www.gnome.org/projects/totem/) will now ask me to install the correct plugin packages to play media it can’t play.
- Cleaner default theme. The default theme for gnome is that little bit nicer and cleaner.
- Newer [Liferea](http://liferea.sourceforge.net/).
- Ephiphany has Titles in the URL drop down.
Overall, it’s not a major change, just a continually progress towards perfection.
