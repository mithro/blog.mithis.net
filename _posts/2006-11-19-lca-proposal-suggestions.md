<p>Firstly, every LCA (<a href="http://linux.conf.au/">linux.conf.au</a>) I have been to has been really brilliant. I’ve been to 6 other conferences and LCA is my definite favourite. I think that for the conference to be this consistently good, there must be because of a huge effort by the organisers and LA.</p>
<p>I’m interested to find out if any of the following suggestions have been considered and why they have possibly been discarded? I’m sure there are obvious reasons I have missed because I have never been part of either the LA committee or the LCA organisers.</p>
<p>A possible “People Choice” track. This would be a track were the talks are selected by the LA members directly. The biggest problem with this type of selection is that it can rapidly turn into a popularity contest. I think this would however be a good way for the LCA committee to check that they are actually providing what people want, by looking at what people are actually voting for.</p>
<p>Why are the submissions not publicly accessible? Having public submissions would have numerous benefits,</p>
<ul>
<li>People would be able to compare their own submissions to others and self evaluate their quality</li>
<li>Allows the community to check the proposals for correctness (IE Person A has actually been involved with projects they say they are)</li>
<li>Allows the community to see all the cool stuff which missed out on being in the conference</li>
<li>Allows the community to make sure that the committee is not “playing favorites” (not that I believe that they ever would)</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposals had to be submitted under an Open Source license anyway so that should not be a problem.</p>
<p>From people’s blogs I know that you only get about 5 minutes per submission. This doesn’t give you much time to write any type of feedback. However, I think a big part of any learning process is getting feedback on your work. A good start would be a set of check boxes which say something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The content of this talk is not related to the conference</li>
<li>The content is of proprietary nature</li>
<li>The content is still too immature</li>
<li>Could not find more information on content</li>
<li>Not enough information for informed decision</li>
<li>Proposal to long, not enough time to read whole thing</li>
<li>Not enough specific detail</li>
<li>Speaker doesn’t have enough experience speaking</li>
<li>Talk better suited for a Miniconf</li>
<li>Talk by other speaker already covered the content</li>
<li>etc….</li>
</ul>
<p>On another feedback note, during the conference it would be nice if there was a way to provide feedback on the talks you attend. I seem to remember there being something similar to this in the past but my memory is failing me.</p>
