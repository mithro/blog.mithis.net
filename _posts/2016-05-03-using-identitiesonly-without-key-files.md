<p>If you want to restrict the keys that ssh tries when connecting to a server, you need to use the <em>IdentityFile</em> and <em>IdentitiesOnly</em> <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config">configuration options in your ssh_config</a>. </p> <p>However, a couple of the keys I have are auto generated, with the key being loaded directly into ssh-agent and never written to a file on disk. For hopefully obvious reasons, you can&#8217;t dump a private key back out of the agent, but it turns out that <em>IdentityFile</em> only needs the public key which you <strong>can</strong> get.</p> <p>I ended up using the following script to dump the public keys to files;</p> <blockquote> <pre><code># Dump the public keys for KEY in $(ssh-add -l | sed -e's/[^ ]\+ [^ ]\+ \([^ ]\+\) .*/\1/'); do if echo $KEY | grep -q '^/'; then continue fi export KEY_FILE="$HOME/.ssh/agent.$(echo $KEY | sed -e's/[^A-Za-z0-9]/_/g').pub" echo "Saving $KEY into $KEY_FILE" ssh-add -L | grep $KEY &gt; $KEY_FILE done </code></pre> </blockquote> <p>Then I added the following to the ssh_config</p> <blockquote><p><code> IdentitiesOnly true<br /> IdentityFile ~/.ssh/agent.keyname.pub<br /> </code> </p></blockquote> <p>When running with &#8220;ssh -vv&#8221; I see the following in the output;</p> <blockquote><p><code>debug2: set_newkeys: mode 1<br /> debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent<br /> debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS<br /> debug2: set_newkeys: mode 0<br /> debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received<br /> debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent<br /> debug2: service_accept: ssh-userauth<br /> debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received<br /> debug2: key: /home/tansell/.ssh/agent.keyb.pub (0x2257da0), explicit<br /> debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,password<br /> debug1: Next authentication method: publickey<br /> debug1: Offering ECDSA public key: //home/tansell/.ssh/agent.keyb.pub<br /> debug2: we sent a publickey packet, wait for reply<br /> </code> </p></blockquote>
