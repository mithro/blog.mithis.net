As everyone should know by now, [Thousand Parsec](http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/) got accepted as a [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/).
It’s been very hectic, but a load of fun. [This graph](https://sourceforge.net/project/stats/detail.php?group_id=132078&ugn=thousandparsec&type=prweb&mode=60day) shows how much extra traffic the SoC has produced. Our IRC channel which normally has about 9 people on it has had around 20.
I’ve been really busy commenting on applications and introducing the newbies. It’s really been a lot of work but I think it will be worth it in the end. The amount of progress which could be made in the 3 months SoC runs for is really huge. A $US 4500 payment is also a good incentive to actually finish what you said you would too.
We have 9 application so far, of which 8 are of very high quality. I would really like to see 30 applications in total, however being realistic we will probably only get around 20.
