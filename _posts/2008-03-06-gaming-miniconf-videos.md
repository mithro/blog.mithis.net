<div ><p>At <a href="http://linux.conf.au">Linux.conf.au 2008</a> the AV team did a great job of recording the main conference and almost all the talks can be <a href="http://www.linux.conf.au/programme/presentations">downloaded</a> from the main website. They where however, unable to record all the miniconf proceedings. I ran the <a href="http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming">Gaming Miniconf</a> again and like last year I was able to record the proceedings myself. It took me a while, but I have finally finished encoding the videos and you can now <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4059511/Gaming_Miniconf___Linux.conf.au_2008_Videos">download the videos</a>. They should be of similar quality to the main conference videos.</p><p>The day on a whole was fairly successfully and there where lots of interesting talks, panels and tutorials. One of the coolest talks was Douglas Bagnall’s “<a href="http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming/Program#Playing_with_Crayons">Playing with Crayons</a>“, while we had a number of technical difficulties with getting his laptop talking to the projector (he has an evil Nvidia card), it was really cool to learn about this program which turns a kid’s crayon drawing into a playable game. Douglas has now <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/tetuhi/">open sourced the code</a> and looking to port it to <a href="http://www.laptop.org/">the OLPC</a>!</p><p>We also had some very cool panels sessions. The first was about using<a href="http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming/Program#FOSS_in_Game_Development_Education_Panel"> FOSS in Game Development education</a>, we had some representatives from some of the <a href="http://homepage.cs.latrobe.edu.au/gtlab">top</a><a href="http://www.rmit.edu.au/">game</a><a href="http://www.qantm.com.au/">education</a> institutes in Australia. The second was an interesting <a href="http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming/Program#Licensing_for_Game_Content_Creators.2C_Talk_.26_Panel">licensing panel</a> which includes Jessica Coats from <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.au/">Creative Commons Australia</a> and Kimberly Weatherall – a former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Wrench">Rusty Wrench winner</a>. I think our last panel was the best however, <a href="http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming/Program#FOSS_in_Commercial_Games_Panel">people got to grill representatives</a> of the Australian commercial game industry on how they are using FOSS at their commercial game companies!</p><p>There where also some really good talks by Richard and Alex about <a href="http://pyglet.org">pyglet</a>, including <span >the most impressive live coding I have ever seen</span>. As the pyglet tutorial is so cool and I have also uploaded it to <a href="http://video.google.com.au/videohosted?docid=-8788197863800411145">Google Video</a> for your viewing pleasure. Of course, we couldn’t keep <a href="http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/">Rusty Russell</a> away, he gave a short lightening talk about his new <a href="http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/ponghero/">Pong Hero</a>!</p><p>So why not <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4059511/Gaming_Miniconf___Linux.conf.au_2008_Videos">download the Gaming Miniconf vidoes and take a look</a>.</p></div>
