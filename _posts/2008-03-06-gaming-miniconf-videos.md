At [Linux.conf.au 2008](http://linux.conf.au) the AV team did a great job of recording the main conference and almost all the talks can be [downloaded](http://www.linux.conf.au/programme/presentations) from the main website. They where however, unable to record all the miniconf proceedings. I ran the [Gaming Miniconf](http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming) again and like last year I was able to record the proceedings myself. It took me a while, but I have finally finished encoding the videos and you can now [download the videos](http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4059511/Gaming_Miniconf___Linux.conf.au_2008_Videos). They should be of similar quality to the main conference videos.
The day on a whole was fairly successfully and there where lots of interesting talks, panels and tutorials. One of the coolest talks was Douglas Bagnall’s “[Playing with Crayons](http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming/Program#Playing_with_Crayons)“, while we had a number of technical difficulties with getting his laptop talking to the projector (he has an evil Nvidia card), it was really cool to learn about this program which turns a kid’s crayon drawing into a playable game. Douglas has now [open sourced the code](http://freshmeat.net/projects/tetuhi/) and looking to port it to [the OLPC](http://www.laptop.org/)!
We also had some very cool panels sessions. The first was about using[ FOSS in Game Development education](http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming/Program#FOSS_in_Game_Development_Education_Panel), we had some representatives from some of the [top](http://homepage.cs.latrobe.edu.au/gtlab)[game](http://www.rmit.edu.au/)[education](http://www.qantm.com.au/) institutes in Australia. The second was an interesting [licensing panel](http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming/Program#Licensing_for_Game_Content_Creators.2C_Talk_.26_Panel) which includes Jessica Coats from [Creative Commons Australia](http://www.creativecommons.org.au/) and Kimberly Weatherall – a former [Rusty Wrench winner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rusty_Wrench). I think our last panel was the best however, [people got to grill representatives](http://miniconf.mel8ourne.org/wiki/index.php?title=Gaming/Program#FOSS_in_Commercial_Games_Panel) of the Australian commercial game industry on how they are using FOSS at their commercial game companies!
There where also some really good talks by Richard and Alex about [pyglet](http://pyglet.org), including the most impressive live coding I have ever seen. As the pyglet tutorial is so cool and I have also uploaded it to [Google Video](http://video.google.com.au/videohosted?docid=-8788197863800411145) for your viewing pleasure. Of course, we couldn’t keep [Rusty Russell](http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/) away, he gave a short lightening talk about his new [Pong Hero](http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/ponghero/)!
So why not [download the Gaming Miniconf vidoes and take a look](http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4059511/Gaming_Miniconf___Linux.conf.au_2008_Videos).
