It would be nice if you could say “swap out these applications at a last choice”.
The main reason for this is that I use the deskbar application quite a lot. I would really like the system not to swap it out so that it is always really responsive.
Searching google doesn’t turn up anything all that useful. I did recently find [memlockd](http://freshmeat.net/projects/memlockd/) which would be quite useful for Servers.
