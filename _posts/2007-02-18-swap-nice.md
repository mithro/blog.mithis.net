<p>It would be nice if you could say “swap out these applications at a last choice”.</p>
<p>The main reason for this is that I use the deskbar application quite a lot. I would really like the system not to swap it out so that it is always really responsive.</p>
<p>Searching google doesn’t turn up anything all that useful. I did recently find <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/memlockd/">memlockd</a> which would be quite useful for Servers.</p>
