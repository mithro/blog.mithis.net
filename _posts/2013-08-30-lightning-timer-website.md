When doing [lightning talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) it is very useful to have a timer so that people don’t over time. There use to be a very simple website called lightningtimer.net but it appears to have gone AWOL. I have set up a mirrored the code at [lightningtimer.cc](lightningtimer.cc) and [lightningtimer.info](lightningtimer.info)
By default it does 5 minutes, but if you can set the hash value to get different times;
- [http://lightningtimer.cc#480](http://lightningtimer.cc#480) – 8 minutes
- [http://lightningtimer.cc#30](http://lightningtimer.cc#30) – 30 seconds
Code found at [https://github.com/simonw/lightningtimer.net](https://github.com/simonw/lightningtimer.net)
