Well, I am currently sitting in the famous [Googleplex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googleplex). I’m attending the [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc) Mentor Summit that Google paid to fly me out for, which is very very cool (thanks Google!). I have never been to the USA before,  so I have about 3 days next week to look around the San Francisco bay area.
Work was suprisingly cool about me disappearing for a week and a half when I had only been working there for 4 weeks!
As [I have said previously](http://blog.mithis.net/archives/uncategorized/49-soc-end), the Summer of Code was a really cool program to be part of and we had some [really](http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpruledev.git;a=summary)[cool](http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=tpserver-cpp.git;a=shortlog;h=rfts)[success](http://git.thousandparsec.net/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=metaserver-lite.git;a=shortlog;h=rewrite). Hopefully we can get in again next year!
