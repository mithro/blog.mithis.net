Last week on friday, I gave a [Tech Talk](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/06/open-source-developers-google-speaker.html) about Open Source Gaming as part of [Leslie Hawthorn’s](http://www.hawthornlandings.org/) “[Open Source Developers @ Google](http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/search/label/oss%20devs)” talk series. For those who were silly enough to miss it, it should be soon coming to a YouTube near you.
I had given a similar talk at [my local LUG](http://www.linuxsa.org.au/meetings/) only recently, I think that version went a little better but it was quite a different crowd. The first part of my talk came across way more preachy then I had hoped. I also see now how I can better use Thousand Parsec as examples of the tips I came up for releasing FOSS games. I guess practice makes perfect, maybe I’ll get it right to one day be able to give it at [Linux.conf.au](http://linux.conf.au/).
At the beginning this time I tried some of the “one word per slide quick succession” talk which [Anthony Baxter](http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2008/Fri/mel8-183.ogg) had suggested. I think however think I ended up just insulting every American! I don’t think I speak fast enough to make this type of talk successful, but I’ll keep experimenting.
If you have any feedback on the talk, please do [send me an email](mailto://mithro@mithis.com)!
The real reason for this post is to [upload the slides for the tech talk so they can be linked from the YouTube video.
*Edit: The talk has now been uploaded, you can access it via the following [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ct36u8RPIU) or see it below,*
