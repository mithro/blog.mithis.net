<div ><p>Last week on friday, I gave a <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/06/open-source-developers-google-speaker.html">Tech Talk</a> about Open Source Gaming as part of <a href="http://www.hawthornlandings.org/">Leslie Hawthorn’s</a> “<a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/search/label/oss%20devs">Open Source Developers @ Google</a>” talk series. For those who were silly enough to miss it, it should be soon coming to a YouTube near you.</p><p>I had given a similar talk at <a href="http://www.linuxsa.org.au/meetings/">my local LUG</a> only recently, I think that version went a little better but it was quite a different crowd. The first part of my talk came across way more preachy then I had hoped. I also see now how I can better use Thousand Parsec as examples of the tips I came up for releasing FOSS games. I guess practice makes perfect, maybe I’ll get it right to one day be able to give it at <a href="http://linux.conf.au/">Linux.conf.au</a>.</p><p>At the beginning this time I tried some of the “one word per slide quick succession” talk which <a href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2008/Fri/mel8-183.ogg">Anthony Baxter</a> had suggested. I think however think I ended up just insulting every American! I don’t think I speak fast enough to make this type of talk successful, but I’ll keep experimenting.</p><p>If you have any feedback on the talk, please do <a href="mailto://mithro@mithis.com">send me an email</a>!</p><p>The real reason for this post is to <a href="/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/techtalk6-pdfable.pdf" | relative_url }}" title="Gaming for Freedom">upload the slides for the tech talk</a> so they can be linked from the YouTube video.</p><p><i>Edit: The talk has now been uploaded, you can access it via the following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ct36u8RPIU">link</a> or see it below,</i></p><p><object height="349" width="425"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/8Ct36u8RPIU&hl=en&rel=0&border=1"/><embed height="349" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/8Ct36u8RPIU&hl=en&rel=0&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"/></object></p></div>
