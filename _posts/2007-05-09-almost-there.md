<p>Well, I’ve almost finished my Honours project, less then a week left until it’s done. I have been working on this project officially for almost a year now, however it’s original inception occurred about 2 and a half years ago.</p>
<p>For those who don’t know, my project is to build a <a href="https://hatty.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/projmgt/current/generalaccess/project_details.php?prj_id=422&year=20063">budget 8 line computer to telephone interface</a>. My hope was to eventually be able to sell the device for $US 150, allowing somebody to interface a whole house cheaply. The design is nothing more then a glorified ADC/DAC device – the computer its connected to does all the work.</p>
<p>I have built a prototype board which is working a lot better then expected, you can see it below. I will however be glad when I can get back to just working on the board instead of writing all this documentation. Anyway, I should get back to it.</p>
