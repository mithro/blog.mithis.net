It would be cool is someone added support to network [Network Manager](http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/) for the following “VPN”s.
- [nstx](http://thomer.com/howtos/nstx.html) or [iodine](http://code.kryo.se/iodine/), tunneling over DNS- [ssh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell), tunneling over ssh- http, tunneling over that “wonderful” web protocolIt would be also good if we could enter proxy servers for particular locations – in many locations in Australia they are mandatory.
