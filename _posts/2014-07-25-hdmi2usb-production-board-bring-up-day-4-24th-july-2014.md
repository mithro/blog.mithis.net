Generally slow progress today, but some success.
- Able to successfully load libFPGALink firmware onto Cypress chip and programmed the FPGA using it. Yay!
- Wrote a test firmware based on http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/DVI-D_Serdes to transmit 720p output from both the TX ports.
<li>Images are successfully received on both devices but there is a weird artifact in the image.
