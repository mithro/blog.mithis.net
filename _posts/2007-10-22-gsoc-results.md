If you read my blog but not the [Thousand Parsec](http://www.thousandparsec.net/)[news feed](http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/rss.php), you might have missed my wrap up of our [Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/soc/). You can find the complete post [here](http://www.thousandparsec.net/tp/news.php/2007-10-20-1302), some highlights include;
>  According to [Oholo](http://www.ohloh.net/), over the summer the students made a total of **371** commits to our public repository, changing a total of **39,050** lines of code.
and
>  Participating in the [Summer of Code](http://www.google.com/soc) has meant that students from around the world have started trying to figure out how to make Thousand Parsec part of their course work. One such student is  [ Nathan Partlan aka greywhind](http://www.ohloh.net/projects/3679/contributors/46709) who is doing a full year internship with Thousand Parsec.
You should check it out.
