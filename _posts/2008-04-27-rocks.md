<div >
<p>A guy on the Summer of Code asked about the following.</p>
<blockquote><p>Linux rocks, FreeBSD rocks – but Linux and FreeBSD rock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is correct use of rock verse rocks but I have no idea why. Suck also works like this,</p>
<blockquote><p>Windows sucks, MacOS X sucks – but Windows and MacOS X suck.</p></blockquote>
<p>This just proves that I know nothing about this language I use every day. Could a linguist please explain this?</p>
