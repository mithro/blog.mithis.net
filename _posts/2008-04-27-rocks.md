A guy on the Summer of Code asked about the following.
> Linux rocks, FreeBSD rocks – but Linux and FreeBSD rock.
Which is correct use of rock verse rocks but I have no idea why. Suck also works like this,
> Windows sucks, MacOS X sucks – but Windows and MacOS X suck.
This just proves that I know nothing about this language I use every day. Could a linguist please explain this?
