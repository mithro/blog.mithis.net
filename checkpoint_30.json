Last year was an exciting time for my personal projects!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1><a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv/timvideos/hdmi2usb/2016/01/11/new-year-roadmap/\">TimVideos.us 2016 New Year’s Resolutions</a></h1>\n<hr/>\n<p>Hello everyone,</p>\n<p>Hope everyone has had an awesome start to 2016 so far. As is tradition in many western countries, I thought I would put together some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_resolution\">New Year’s Resolutions</a> and reflect on our progress in 2015. I guess more business minded people might call it a “project roadmap” 🙂</p>\n<h3 id=\"timvideos-project\"><a href=\"https://code.timvideos.us/\">TimVideos Project</a></h3>\n<p>In 2015, I decided to focus the <a href=\"https://code.timvideos.us/\">TimVideos project</a> on the <a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv/\">HDMI2USB project</a>. The three key results of this focus were;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starting and completing a <a href=\"https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-misoc-firmware\">rewrite of the HDMI2USB firmware</a> based on the <a href=\"http://m-labs.hk/gateware.html\">Migen and MiSoC system developed by M-Labs</a>.</li>\n<li>Launching a <a href=\"http://crowdsupply.com/numato-lab/opsis\">successful crowdfunding campaign</a> for <a href=\"https://github.com/timvideos/HDMI2USB-numato-opsis-hardware\">Numato Opsis</a>, our first open hardware for the HDMI2USB firmware.</li>\n<li>Having the HDMI2USB firmware on Atlys boards used in production by multiple people!\n<ul>\n<li>Carl Karsten from <a href=\"http://nextdayvideo.com/\">NextDayVideo</a> in the US for both PyCon ZA and Nodevember.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Videoteam\">DebConf Video team</a> for their <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/gb/2015/MiniDebConfCambridge#Video\">MiniDebConf in November</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/mithro\">Myself for recording</a> my own talks on the HDMI2USB project at user groups here in Sydney!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the success of this focus in 2015, the <a href=\"https://code.timvideos.us/\">TimVideos project</a> is going to continue to focus on the<a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv/\">HDMI2USB project</a> for 2016 (and I’ll go into more detailed goals shortly).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://code.timvideos.us/\">TimVideos project</a> has also been mildly successful in collaborating with other open source groups doing things related to video recording and production. In 2016, I hope we can strengthen these bonds and forge new ones. Some specific goals around this include;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting the TimVideos project to join <a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/\">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> (or similar organisation).</li>\n<li>Figure out the right way to collaborate with the <a href=\"https://c3voc.de/\">C3VOC team</a> on <a href=\"https://github.com/voc/voctomix\">voctomix</a> and start adding missing features from <a href=\"https://github.com/timvideos/gst-switch\">gst-switch</a> allowing that project to be retired.</li>\n<li>Continue to work with supporting groups like <a href=\"http://nextdayvideo.com/\">NextDayVideo</a>, the <a href=\"https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Videoteam\">DebConf Video team</a> and <a href=\"https://linux.org.au/\">Linux Australia</a>.</li>\n<li>Support and help <a href=\"http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/FPGA_Projects\">Mike “Hamster” Field</a> continue to develop a <a href=\"https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_DisplayPort\">fully open source DisplayPort core</a>.</li>\n<li>Collaborate with the <a href=\"http://apertus.org/\">apertus° project</a> on high end (4k and greater!) video capture and processing.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"hdmi2usb-project\"><a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv\">HDMI2USB Project</a></h3>\n<p>As we are concentrating on the <a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv\">HDMI2USB project</a>, we have some specific goals around that.</p>\n<p>HDMI2USB <strong>firmware</strong> goals;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactor the HDMI core to allow support a wider range of interfaces, better debugging and addition of more features. A document about the refactor has been <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/mithis.com/document/d/1L8lz7u2uj6MrzSQv4b1Vk6Rmic26okyRklOju5IWLYA/edit?usp=drive_web\">started here</a>.</li>\n<li>Add support for the <a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv/timvideos/hdmi2usb/2016/01/11/new-year-roadmap/\">high-speed GTP transceivers</a> and <a href=\"http://hamsterworks.co.nz/mediawiki/index.php/FPGA_Projects\">Mike “Hamster” Field</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/hamsternz/FPGA_DisplayPort\">open source DisplayPort core</a>.</li>\n<li>Get Ethernet support working (on both the Atlys and Opsis boards). The two major Ethernet features are;\n<ul>\n<li>Ethernet supports identical capture and control feature set to the USB port.</li>\n<li>Allowing HDMI2USB boards to act has “HDMI over Ethernet extenders”.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hdmi2usb.tv/potential-boards/\">Support for more hardware</a>;\n<ul>\n<li>miniSpartan6+</li>\n<li>Digilent Nexys Video</li>\n<li>New HDMI2USB designed hardware!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Stretch Goals (1)\n<ul>\n<li>Add support for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZjM1Brrks0lg1CJp2Rt1BH8-MhJamrKUeCUB4s4nzoA/edit\">hardware based mixing</a>.</li>\n<li>Have either a RTOS or Linux running on the FPGA softcore.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HDMI2USB <strong>hardware</strong> goals;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(By end of year) Development of a low cost PCI-Express capture card.</li>\n<li>(By middle 2017) Development of an Opsis V2 based around either an high end Artix-7 or a low end Kintex-7 FPGA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>(1): Stretch goals are things we plan to try and achieve if things go well.</em></p>\n<p>Hope this update give you an idea of what we have planned for 2016!

Some of the reasons we decided to start from scratch was;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A “de facto standard” for locking HDMI ports was established and low cost connectors became available. This meant we no longer needed to support both DVI and HDMI connectors, reducing the complexity significantly and solving some persistent issues.</li>\n<li>Not only did the cost of Spartan 6 parts with high speed “GTP” transceivers drop but our understanding of how to use them increased. This would allow us to create a board which natively supports DisplayPort.</li>\n<li>The idea streaming via not only USB, but also Ethernet became a stronger possibility, meaning the extra cost of adding ethernet was now worth it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, our board has the following differences with the Atlys board;</p>\n<ul style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Has DDR3 memory instead of DDR2, increasing the memory bandwidth.</span></li>\n<li>Has a Spartan S6LX45<strong>T</strong> with the GTP broken out to DisplayPort headers.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Has a PCI-Express style expansion connector instead of the expensive VHDCI connector, allow much cheaper expansion boards.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Has all the extra pins on the FX2, increasing the potential USB interface options.</span></li>\n<li>Has control over all the HDMI functionality, including hot plug and CEC functionality.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Removes parts we don’t need such as the audio, </span>buttons, switches and LEDs.</li>\n<li>Mounts in any ITX style computer case.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Adds UTMI USB (as well as the Cypress FX2)</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">Adds MicroSD connector.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>",

    "title": "Connecting to a Fritz!Box under Linux using vpnc",
    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\n<p>I have two <a href=\"http://fritzbox.com.au/product-fritz-wlan7390.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fritz!Box 7390</a> (one at my place and one at my parents primary residence) and one <a href=\"http://fritzbox.com.au/product-fritz-wlan7270.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fritz!Box 7270 devices</a> (the house they are building). They are pretty reasonable “high end” ADSL routers and a cool feature is they integrated VPN support. I use this functionality to connect the three networks securely together (but that is not what this post is about). This VPN functionality can also be used to connect to your home network while not at home, but information on how to do this from Linux is very sparse (specially if you only want to use FOSS tools to do the connection), so here is how I did it.</p>\n<h2>Configuring your Fritz!Box</h2>\n<p>To set up your Fritz!Box you need a configuration file, there is no GUI available in the web interface to support create new VPN configurations. While a number of sites have pre-built .cfg files that look like they should work, my Fritz!Boxes only accept encrypted VPN configuration files (see end of post for more information) and no open source tool exists to encrypt them.</p>\n<p>I instead needed to use the FRITZ!Box VPN Connection tool (while it is a Windows program but runs fine under Wine) to create the configuration. It can be downloaded from the <a href=\"http://webgw.avm.de/download/Download_en.jsp?partid=14657\" target=\"_blank\">AVM website</a> (This is different to the VPN client that AVM also provide). Annoyingly the tool doesn’t just read existing .cfg configuration files, it instead reads it’s own vpnadmin.cfg found in <code>c:/users/your username/Application Data/AVM/FRITZ!VPN</code> and then generates a .cfg file and encrypts it.</p>\n<p>Using the FRITZ!Box VPN Connection tool to create a configuration that is compatible with vpnc you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Select “Configure VPN for one User” type connection</li>\n<li>On the “Select Device” screen, select “iPhone, iPod touch or iPad” option</li>\n<li>On the “Enter the user’s email address” screen, despite the admin tool calling this field the user email, just enter a username. I recommend <strong>not</strong> having any special characters like @ or . in it.</li>\n<li>On the “Enter IP address of the User” screen, be careful about what IP address you use (the default should be okay).\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t use the same IP address that the computer uses when connected via wireless/wired. While it seems like a good idea, as the computer would have the same IP address even when remote, it <strong>does not work</strong> and will mean the device is unable to access the internet when connected to wireless/wired.</li>\n<li>The “Send all data over the VPN tunnel” option on this page does not seem to affect vpnc, it will always route all your data over the vpn connection. See later for how to fix this problem.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>On the “Key for the connection” screen enter a password. Copy down the shared secret key, you’ll want it when creating the vpnc config. I recommend also keeping the default shared secret key it generates unless your super paranoid about entropy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can check that you have done this correctly in two ways;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The vpnadmin.cfg will have the <code>iphone=1</code> and <code>xauth_key=\"your password\"</code> options. See below for a partial example;<br/>\n<code>\n<pre>\r\n...\r\n  user {\r\n    nameoremail = \"xxxx\";\r\n    key = \"xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\";\r\n    ip = 192.168.179.201;\r\n    internetaccess = 0;\r\n    <strong>iphone = 1;\r\n    xauth_key = \"xxxxx\";</strong>\r\n  }\r\n...\r\n</pre>\n<p></p></code></li>\n<li>If you export an unencrypted config file (remember this can’t be loaded onto the Fritz!Box – so make sure you also export an encrypted version!), the remoteid section will have a key field and not a fqdn field, use_xauth will be set to yes and an xauth section will exist. See below for a partial example;<br/>\n<code>\n<pre>\r\n...\r\n  keepalive_ip = 0.0.0.0;\r\n  remoteid {\r\n    <strong>key_id</strong> = \"qnap\";\r\n  }\r\n  mode = phase1_mode_aggressive;\r\n  phase1ss = \"all/all/all\";\r\n  keytype = connkeytype_pre_shared;\r\n  key = \"f3e0hcca19ca2a3gaafbI.{1dGe3q8f84\";\r\n  cert_do_server_auth = no;\r\n  use_nat_t = yes;\r\n  <strong>use_xauth = yes;\r\n  xauth {\r\n    valid = yes;\r\n    username = \"qnap\";\r\n    passwd = \"qnappassword\";\r\n  }</strong>\r\n  use_cfgmode = yes;\r\n...</pre>\n<p></p></code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Configuring vpnc on your Linux box</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Fritz!Box needs both draft-ietf-ipsec-nat-t-ike-03 support and the client to adopt the server suggested lifetime (which for the Fritz!Box is 3600 seconds). These features where only added to vpnc recently, so make sure your vpnc is newer than subversion revision 511. Both the version in Debian Unstable and any Ubuntu newer than Precise (12.04) have vpnc 0.5.3r512, which is new enough version and you can just <code>apt-get install vpnc</code>. For Fedora 17 x86 systems you can find RPMs at http://www.pabloendres.com/2013/02/27/vpnc-and-fritzbox/</p>\n<p>Create the vpnc config in <code>/etc/vpnc/fritzbox.conf</code> using the following as a template (replace the parts in bold/brackets):<br/>\n<code>\n<pre>\r\nIPSec gateway <strong>ip address or DNS name of your FritzBox</strong>\r\n\r\nIKE DH Group dh2\r\nPerfect Forward Secrecy nopfs\r\n\r\nIPSec ID <strong>[username entered into the \"Enter the user's email address\" screen]</strong>\r\n# \"key\" from the Fritz!Box VPN configuration\r\nIPSec secret <strong>[shared secret key from the \"Key for the connection\" screen]</strong>\r\n\r\nNAT Traversal Mode force-natt\r\n\r\nXauth username <strong>[username entered into the \"Enter the user's email address\" screen]</strong>\r\nXauth password <strong>[password entered into the \"Key for the connection\" screen - Not the password use to encrypt the vpnc configuration!]</strong>\r\n</pre>\n<p></p></code></p>\n<p>As this file contains usernames and password, the config file should be owned by root and only readable by the owner.<br/>\n<code><br/>\nsudo chown root /etc/vpnc/fritzbox.conf<br/>\nsudo chmod 0600 /etc/vpnc/fritzbox.conf<br/>\n</code></p>\n<p>You should now be able to connect to your home internet using:<br/>\n<code><br/>\nsudo vpnc-connect fritzbox<br/>\n</code></p>\n<p>When you are finished, use:<br/>\n<code><br/>\nsudo vpnc-disconnect fritzbox<br/>\n</code></p>\n<h2>Internet Access while using vpnc</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>When vpnc connects it will change your default route to go via the tunnel. This will send all your local internet traffic over the VPN connection. If you are setting up the VPN to secure your internet browsing while on a hostile network such as a public WiFi hotspot (such as at a coffee shop) this is what you want.</p>\n<p>However, if you just want to be able to access the hosts on your home network, you don’t want this as it will make your internet browsing extraordinarily slow.  These routes are set up by <code>/etc/vpn/vpnc-script</code> script, so you will need custom one. Normally this script is provided a lot of information when connecting to other VPN concentrators (such as a Cisco EasyVPN device) but when connecting to the Fritz!Box you only seem to get limited information.</p>\n<p>I created the following script in <code>/etc/vpnc/fritzbox-script</code>, marked it as executable (<code>chmod a+x /etc/vpnc/fritzbox-script</code>) and then added “<code>Script /etc/vpnc/fritzbox-script</code>” to my <code>/etc/vpnc/fritzbox.conf</code> file.</p>\n<p><code>\n<pre>\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n\r\nIPROUTE=/sbin/ip\r\n\r\ncase \"$reason\" in\r\n  pre-init)\r\n    /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script pre-init\r\n    ;;\r\n  connect)\r\n    INTERNAL_IP4_PREFIX=$(echo $INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS | sed -e's/\\.[0-9]\\+$//')\r\n    $IPROUTE link set dev \"$TUNDEV\" up mtu 1024\r\n    $IPROUTE addr add \"$INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS/255.255.255.0\" peer \"$INTERNAL_IP4_ADDRESS\" dev \"$TUNDEV\"\r\n    $IPROUTE route replace \"$INTERNAL_IP4_PREFIX.0/255.255.255.0\" dev \"$TUNDEV\"\r\n    $IPROUTE route flush cache\r\n    ;;\r\n  disconnect)\r\n    $IPROUTE link set dev \"$TUNDEV\" down\r\n    ;;\r\n  *)\r\n    echo \"unknown reason '$reason'. Maybe vpnc-script is out of date\" 1&gt;&amp;2\r\n    exit 1\r\n    ;;\r\nesac\r\nexit 0\r\n</pre></code>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Fritz!Box encrypted VPN configuration files</h2>\n<p>Fritz!Boxes will <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">only accept VPN configurations which are encrypted</span>. Otherwise when try to import the file you will get the cryptic \"Error: Import of the VPN settings failed.\" as seen below;<br/>\n<img alt=\"Error: Import of the VPN settings failed.\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1835\" height=\"265\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\" src=\"https://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/VPN-error.png\" srcset=\"https://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/VPN-error.png 745w, https://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/VPN-error-300x106.png 300w\" width=\"745\"/></p>\n<p>To create an encrypted file you must use the FRITZ!Box VPN Connection tool. Then when exporting, select \"Save VPN settings in a file under\" option, check the \"Encrypt VPN settings\" check box (the file type should change to .eff), and enter your chosen password twice.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Export VPN settings\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1836\" height=\"306\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" src=\"https://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/VPN-encrypt.png\" srcset=\"https://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/VPN-encrypt.png 442w, https://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/VPN-encrypt-300x207.png 300w\" width=\"442\"/></p></blockquote>\n</p></div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Here at Google we have quite a few remote file systems which contain various tools we use in our day-to-day work. As typing sucks we generally want the tools in our $PATH. When you try to tab complete Bash needs to <a href=\"http://linux.die.net/man/2/stat\">stat</a> a couple of thousand files and even on fast remote file systems this takes a drastically long time.</p>\n<p>I wrote FastComplete as a solution to this problem. The tool creates a local cache of links on your hard drive to everything in your $PATH. It uses a couple of tricks to make sure all the stats remain locally, while still allowing the remote file to change without needing to update the cache. Linux should also keep this information in memory disk cache making tab completion almost instant again. Yay!</p>\n<p>You can find FastComplete at <a href=\"https://github.com/mithro/rcfiles/blob/master/bin/fastcomplete\">https://github.com/mithro/rcfiles/blob/master/bin/fastcomplete</a> It is a stand alone python program which shouldn’t have any non-core dependencies.

This is a wonderful tool which allows people to develop “hot patches” so that you never need to reboot again. The developers have done some very cool work which means for 88% of patches a hot fix can be generated automatically. The presenter was a really great speaker too, during the talk he explains some advanced concepts (like hot to fix-up memory structures) I was able to easily understand it all. I can’t watch until I <strong>never</strong> have to reboot my Linux machines again!</p>\n<p>I also attended <a href=\"http://ozlabs.org/~rusty/\">Rusty</a>‘s tutorial on hacking <a href=\"http://http://lguest.ozlabs.org/\">lguest</a>.

This year I didn’t get as far as I had wanted mostly because I had not gotten enough sleep the night before. I did however submit one patch which was accepted.

However, what I spent most of my time was spent making bad programmer art, that of the particularly gruesome child death animation. I like to think it was this artwork that meant we won top spot at the <a href=\"http://games.sericyb.com.au/\">Gaming Miniconf</a> competition, beating the “Shave Bdale” game.</p>\n<p>You can download the game from the <a href=\"http://git.sugarlabs.org/projects/one-velociraptor-per-child\">git repository</a>.

    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>So last year at the end of November I spoke at OSDC. I had been meaning to blog about the conference but never gotten around to doing so. The conference was great, but like previous OSDC’s I came down with something. Sadly, this meant that missed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tridgell\">Andrew Tridgell’s</a> talk about the <a href=\"http://people.samba.org/people/2008/10/22#a-year-since-microsofts-appeal-failed\">EU-Microsoft agreement</a>. Joel, who had been camped out in my lounge room for the week, said it was really worth listening too. I really wish OSDC recorded all the talks like Linux.conf.au does.</p>\n<p>As part of speaking at the conference I had to produce a paper. This paper puts into writing a lot of what I have <a href=\"http://blog.mithis.net/archives/games/82-techtalk-gamingforfreedom\">been talking about</a>. I wasn’t going to post it, but after getting a email out of the blue about the topic, I’ve decided to <a href=\"http://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/osdc-paper.pdf\">put a copy here on my blog</a>. I might as well also upload the <a href=\"http://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/osdc-presentation.pdf\">presentation I gave</a>, but it won’t be very interesting by itself. Both are released under a CC-BY-SA.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing that any budding game developer (open source or otherwise) should take away from this talk, it is the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When a person is looking for normal software, <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">they have an issue to solve.</span><br/>\nWhen looking for computer games, <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">they are looking to be entertained.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>This fundamental difference in mindset should drive every aspect of your game, website and release process.</p>\n<p><i>Edit: How could I forget? A big thanks goes out to <a href=\"http://www.hawthornlandings.org/\">Leslie Hawthorn</a> who helped proof read the paper and making it much easier to read!</i></p>\n</div>",

As I lasted mentioned I now work at Google, which has been going well but keeping me fairly busy. For the last month (October, 2009) I have been back in Mountain View, California. While I was there for mainly work purposes, I did get the chance to go to both the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/soc\">Summer of Code</a> <a href=\"https://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/Main_Page\">Mentor Summit</a> and the <a href=\"http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/GitTogether\">GitTogether</a>. Both where a lot of fun but tiering. </p>\n<p>It was good to see the <a href=\"http://bzflag.org\">BZFlag</a> guys again – they even had cool t-shirts this year. Not as cool as our <a href=\"http://www.cafepress.com/thousandparsec.123836466\">Thousand Parsec shirts</a>, however. 🙂 I was finally able to meet kblin who I had know through the <a href=\"http://www.worldforge.org\">WorldForge</a> project for many years. As always he looked nothing like I expected.</p>\n<p>At the GitTogther I was mainly interested in trying to make git usable with large media repositories. This is one area which Subversion still has an advantage. After much discussion we came up with a solution to the problem which <a href=\"http://www.thousandparsec.net/~tim/media+git.pdf\">I gave a short presentation</a>.</p>\n<p>It also gave me a chance to catch up with the Open Source Progams Office. It was great to catch up with <a href=\"http://www.hawthornlandings.org/\">Leslie Hawthorn</a> and her fabulous crew.</p>\n<p>No sooner had I gotten back from the states, I headed of to New Zealand. <a href=\"http://llnz.dyndns.org/\">Lee Begg</a> who I also first met through the WorldForge project and was the co-founder of the Thousand Parsec project, is getting married and I will be a grooms man.</p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>Last week on friday, I gave a <a href=\"http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/06/open-source-developers-google-speaker.html\">Tech Talk</a> about Open Source Gaming as part of <a href=\"http://www.hawthornlandings.org/\">Leslie Hawthorn’s</a> “<a href=\"http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/search/label/oss%20devs\">Open Source Developers @ Google</a>” talk series. For those who were silly enough to miss it, it should be soon coming to a YouTube near you.</p>\n<p>I had given a similar talk at <a href=\"http://www.linuxsa.org.au/meetings/\">my local LUG</a> only recently, I think that version went a little better but it was quite a different crowd. The first part of my talk came across way more preachy then I had hoped. I also see now how I can better use Thousand Parsec as examples of the tips I came up for releasing FOSS games. I guess practice makes perfect, maybe I’ll get it right to one day be able to give it at <a href=\"http://linux.conf.au/\">Linux.conf.au</a>.</p>\n<p>At the beginning this time I tried some of the “one word per slide quick succession” talk which <a href=\"http://mirror.linux.org.au/linux.conf.au/2008/Fri/mel8-183.ogg\">Anthony Baxter</a> had suggested. I think however think I ended up just insulting every American! I don’t think I speak fast enough to make this type of talk successful, but I’ll keep experimenting.</p>\n<p>If you have any feedback on the talk, please do <a href=\"mailto://mithro@mithis.com\">send me an email</a>!</p>\n<p>The real reason for this post is to <a href=\"http://blog.mithis.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/techtalk6-pdfable.pdf\" title=\"Gaming for Freedom\">upload the slides for the tech talk</a> so they can be linked from the YouTube video.</p>\n<p><i>Edit: The talk has now been uploaded, you can access it via the following <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ct36u8RPIU\">link</a> or see it below,</i></p>\n<p><object height=\"349\" width=\"425\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/8Ct36u8RPIU&amp;hl=en&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1\"/><embed height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/8Ct36u8RPIU&amp;hl=en&amp;rel=0&amp;border=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\"/></object></p>\n</div>",
