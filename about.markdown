### Background

I'm passionate about open source hardware and software development, with a focus on video processing, FPGA development, and embedded systems. This blog serves as a documentation platform for technical projects and discoveries.

This blog is migrated from WordPress to Jekyll while preserving the original Barthelme theme design.
